# Dynamic List Manager

## Objective
Develop a simple React application that dynamically allows users to add items to a list using an input field and a button. The final design should match the provided reference image.

## Requirements
- The application should display an empty list when it loads.
- An input field should be provided for users to enter text.
- An "Add Item" button should be available for users to submit input.
- When the user clicks the button:
  - The text from the input field should be added to the list.
  - The input field should be cleared after submission.
  - If the input field is empty and the button is clicked, no new item should be added to the list.
- The applicationâ€™s styling should resemble the reference image provided.

## Styling Guidelines
- Use a clean and minimal design with a modern UI.
- The input field and button should be styled as shown in the reference image.
- The list items should be displayed inside a bordered and lightly shaded container.
- The application should have a professional and polished look.

## Expected Behavior & Interaction

### Initial State
- The list is empty.
- The input field is empty.

### User Action 1
1. The user types "First Item" in the input field.

### User Action 2
